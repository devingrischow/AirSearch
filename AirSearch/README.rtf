\f0\fs24 \cf0 This version of ADAM is for the DBM Final Project, Work will continue to be done and perfected on this afterwords. All past ADAM plans stay in effect, but for this project specifically some adam features don\'92t have to be perfect, they can be perfected later. This version of Adam can be considered its WEB INTERFACE version, the plug and code version is still desired and should be researched upon. }
